# Types of Inheritance
# 1.SINGLE INHERITANCE = Single Inheritance is the simplest form of 
# inheritance where a single child class is derived from a single parent class

# class Parent:                  
#     # parent class
#     def hello1(self):
#         print("This is Parrent Class")
# class Child(Parent):    
#   # child class
#     def hello2(self):               
#         print("This is Child Class")                            
# a = Child()                 
# a.hello1()                 
# a.hello2()         

# 2.MULTIPLE INHERITANCE = In multiple inheritance, a single child 
# class is inherited from two or more parent(base) classes. It means the 
# child(derived) class has access to all the parent classes' methods and attributes.
